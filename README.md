## Background
Hiii 👋🏻,

I'm Hoang, this is a project for a second-year CS course, [CS 246](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs246/S23/index.shtml), at University of Waterloo 🇨🇦. I took this course when I was on exchange, yes, I was an exchange student from Vietnam 🇻🇳.

**CC3k** is my first ever personal project and I have put a lot of effort into it. The project was built on top of `C++` using different `OOP` concepts like `Inheritance`, `Polymorphism`, and `Encapsulation`.

This is a game where we control a hero ⚔️ to explore dungeon with different floors and different chambers. A long the way, there will be many item that we can pick up and use like Gold or Potion. And of course, the most important component of the game is the Enemy 😈 which can come from different kinds with different abilities, who is always ready to fight our hero!

Hope you guys will like it!

Cheers 🤗, <br>
Hoang Dang.
