## Background
Hiii 👋🏻,

I'm Hoang, this is a project for a second-year CS course, [CS 246](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs246/S23/index.shtml), at University of Waterloo 🇨🇦. I took this course when I was on exchange, yes, I was an exchange student from Vietnam 🇻🇳.

**CC3k** is my first ever personal project and I have put a lot of effort into it. The project was built on top of `C++` using different `OOP` concepts like `Inheritance`, `Polymorphism`, and `Encapsulation`.

This is a game where we control a hero ⚔️ to explore dungeon with different floors and different chambers. A long the way, there will be many item that we can pick up and use like Gold or Potion. And the most important component of the game is the Enemy 😈 which can come from different kinds with different abilities, who is always ready to fight our hero!

Hope you guys will like it!

Cheers 🤗, <br>
Hoang Dang.
